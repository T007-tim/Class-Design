# Class-Design
This project provides a practical demonstration of polymorphism and inheritance in object-oriented programming. By exploring the Smartphone and Vehicle classes, we see how these two fundamental concepts work in action.  You can expand this project further by adding more functionality to the classes, like adding more vehicle types.
